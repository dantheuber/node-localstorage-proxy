# node-localStorage-proxy

The goal of this package is to provide an extremely simple express server which can be hosted on any subdomain to provide the ability to read and write values in the `localStorage` for the subdomain it is hosted on.

Based on the blog post https://jcubic.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/cross-domain-localstorage/
Made simple with https://gist.github.com/jlong/2428561
